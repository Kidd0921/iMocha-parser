# Level 2 Programming Test: Call Record Parser

## Author
Hoh Zheng Jie

## Problem Summary

This Java program parses a fixed-width ASCII text file generated by a telephone network system. Each line represents a call or message transaction. The program produces a summary report with:

1. Total cost of calls per **account number**
2. Total cost of calls per **call type** (Phone call, SMS, MMS)
3. Total cost of calls per **day** (based on call start date)

---

## How to Build and Run

### Using IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the project in IntelliJ
2. Place `input.txt` in the **project root directory** (not inside `src`)
3. Right-click `parser.java` â†’ **Run**
4. `report.txt` will be generated in the root directory

### Using Terminal (Command Line)

```bash
javac parser.java
java parser
```
# Assumptions
- Each input line is fixed-width with **exactly 74 characters**

- Fields are right-padded with spaces

- Cost is in sen

- Call types are:

  - **P = Phone call**

  - **S = SMS**

  - **M = MMS**

- There is only one input file per run

- Invalid or incomplete lines are skipped safely

- Output report is overwritten every time

| Test Case | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TC1       | One record: phone call (`P`) only                                           |
| TC2       | One record: SMS (`S`) only                                                  |
| TC3       | One record: MMS (`M`) only                                                  |
| TC4       | Multiple records for the **same account number**                            |
| TC5       | Multiple records for the **same call type**                                 |
| TC6       | Records spanning **different dates** (`YYYYMMDD` based on `STT_TIME`)       |
| TC7       | Input lines **less than 74 characters** are **skipped safely**              |
| TC8       | Correct **accumulation** of costs by account, call type, and date           |
| TC9       | `report.txt` is correctly **overwritten** with every run                    |
